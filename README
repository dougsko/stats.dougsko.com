This site is built using webgen and is powered by a few shell scripts
and rrdtool.  Due to its simplicity, it should be trivial to drop this
site onto any other linux server and have it just work.  It is also easy
to expand this site's monitoring capabilities.

All of the source files for this site are under the 'src' directory.  In
order to add a new statistic for this site to monitor, you can do the
following:

  1. Copy one of the existing stats folders, like, 'net', and give it a
  new name.
  2. Change the name of the graphing shell script to reflect the name of
  the stat.
  3. Edit the shell script so that it does what you want.  There are
  three main sections to this file, database creation, database
  updating, and graph creation.
  4. Edit the index.page file so that it has the proper names of the
  images rrdtool creates.

Make sure to set up a cron job to run the updater.sh script.  This
script runs all the other scripts in each of the monitoring sections.
The cronjob should run every five minutes, so something like this should
work:

  */5 * * * * /path/to/updater.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
